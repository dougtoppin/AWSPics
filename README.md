# AWSPics

> An AWS CloudFormation stack to run a serverless password-protected photo
  gallery

**Demo:** <https://awspics.net>  
**Credentials:** "username" / "password"

## Goals

Host a self-contained, declarative infrastructure, password-protected,
data-driven static photo gallery to share personal pictures with friends and
family, without needing to run, maintain (or pay for) servers.

## Architecture

![](assets/architecture.png)

There are 7 main components:

1. **CloudFront with restricted bucket access** to prevent unauthenticated
   access to the site or its pictures.
2. **Login lambda function** to validate authentication and sign cookies to
   allow access to restricted buckets.
3. **Source S3 bucket** to store original pictures and metadata driving the
   site.
4. **Resized S3 bucket** to store resized versions of the original pictures.
5. **Web S3 bucket** to store the static website generated from the data in the
   source bucket.
6. **Resize lambda function** to automatically resize images added to the source
   S3 bucket and store them in the resized S3 bucket.
7. **Site builder lambda function** to automatically rebuild the static website
   when changes are made to the source S3 bucket.

## Pre-requisites

Requires that `aws-cli`, `docker` and `htpasswd` be installed.

You'll also need a domain whose CNAME DNS value you can update.

## Instructions

A video walkthrough [is available on YouTube](https://youtu.be/010AGcY4uoE).

1. Configure `aws-cli` (recommended to use `us-east-1`, see "Miscellaneous"
   below):
   ```
   $ aws configure
   AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIA...
   AWS Secret Access Key [None]: illx...
   Default region name [None]: us-east-1
   Default output format [None]:
   $ aws configure set preview.cloudfront true
   ```
2. Create KMS encryption key: `aws kms create-key`. Keep note of its `KeyId` in
   the response. Note that each KMS key costs $1/month.
   Include some descriptive information for reference later.

   ```
   $ aws kms create-key --description "for awspics"
   ```

   The output from the create-key should include a `KeyId` field.
   Use that when setting an alias for the key.
   Alias appears on the kms console key list making it easier to identify what the key is used for.

   ```
   $ aws kms create-alias --alias-name alias/awspics --target-key-id xxx
   ```

3. Create CloudFront Key Pair, take note of the key pair ID and download the
   private key:
   <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/security_credential>.
4. Encrypt the CloudFront private key:
   ```
   aws kms encrypt --key-id $KMS_KEY_ID --plaintext "$(cat pk-*.pem)" \
                   --query CiphertextBlob --output text
   ```
5. Create a local `htpasswd` file with your usernames and passwords.
   You can generate the hashes from the command line:
   ```
   $ htpasswd -nB username > htpasswd
   New password: **********
   Re-type new password: **********
   ```
6. Encrypt your `htpasswd` file using KMS again:
   ```
   aws kms encrypt --key-id $KMS_KEY_ID --plaintext "$(cat htpasswd)" \
                   --query CiphertextBlob --output text
   ```
7. Create CloudFront Origin Access Identity, take note of the identity in the
   response:
   ```
   aws cloudfront create-cloud-front-origin-access-identity \
                  --cloud-front-origin-access-identity-config \
                  "CallerReference=$(cat /dev/urandom | base64 | base64 | head -c 14),Comment=AWSPics OAI"
   ```

## Deployment

Create a configuration file called `dist/config.json`, based on
[config.example.json](config.example.json). Make sure you don't commit this file
to source control (the `dist` folder is ignored).

It should contain the following info - minus the comments:

```js
[
  // -------------------
  // PLAIN TEXT SETTINGS
  // -------------------

  // website domain
  "website=website.com",
  // title for the website
  "websiteTitle=My awesome private photo gallery",
  // S3 bucket where the static website generated from the data in the
  // source bucket will be stored
  "webBucket=html-files-here",
  // S3 bucket where original pictures and metadata driving the site will be
  // stored
  "sourceBucket=original-images-here",
  // S3 bucket where resized images will be stored
  "resizedBucket=resized-images-here",
  // Origin Access Identity from step 7
  "originAccessIdentity=EJG...",
  // how long the CloudFront access is granted for, in seconds
  // note that the cookies are session cookies, and will get deleted when the
  // browser is closed anyway
  "sessionDuration=86400",
  // KMS key ID created in step 2
  "kmsKeyId=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  // CloudFront key pair ID from step 3
  // This is not sensitive, and will be one of the cookie values
  "cloudFrontKeypairId=APK...",

  // ------------------
  // ENCRYPTED SETTINGS
  // ------------------

  // encrypted CloudFront private key from step 4
  "encryptedCloudFrontPrivateKey=AQICAH...",

  // encrypted contents of the <htpasswd> file from step 6
  "encryptedHtpasswd=AQICAH..."
]
```

You can then deploy the full stack using:

```bash
# name of an S3 bucket for storing the Lambda code
# bucket will be created if it doesn't already exist
./deploy awspics-lambda
```

Any subsequent changes that you make to this code can be redeployed with the
same command. CloudFormation will create a "changeset" to only update the
modified resources.

The first deployment should take about 30 minutes since there's a lot to set up.
You'll also receive an email to approve the SSL certificate request, which you
should complete quickly, so that the rest of the deployment can proceed.

Once the initial deployment is done, you'll need to point your domain's DNS
settings to add a CNAME to the newly created CloudFront Distribution URL, which
you can find by visiting the CloudFront section of the AWS Console. Once the DNS
update has propagated, you'll be able to access your private photo gallery at
that domain. However, there's no content yet, so you won't see much of anything.
You can generate sample albums to see it in action.

## Generate Sample Albums

There's a script included that will pull random images from
[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) to populate your photo gallery with sample
content.

```bash
./generate_random_albums <number of albums>
```

### How the Authentication Works

The Lambda function responsible for logging in creates signed session cookies
when given valid credentials. CloudFront will verify that every request has
valid cookies before forwarding them.

```

  |                           |                    |                 |

  |                           | -----------------------------------> |
  |                           | <------------ html page ------------ |
  | <------ html page ------- |
```

## Miscellaneous

This project only works as-is if everything is set up in the `us-east-1` AWS
region, because CloudFormation only supports SSL certificates from that region.
It's not too difficult to adapt this to work in another region, but you can't
rely on the SSL certificate being created in CloudFormation. Create it manually
(using either the AWS Console or the CLI) and reference it in the
`WebDistribution` by its ARN explicitly rather than the `!Ref SSLCert`
reference.
